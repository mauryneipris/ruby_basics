# Implement a method #stock_picker that takes in an array of stock prices, 
# one for each hypothetical day. 
# It should return a pair of days(array indexes of lowest and highest value) representing the best day to buy
# and the best day to sell. Days start at 0.

def stock_picker.rb(array)
  #return index of lowest value and highest value
end
